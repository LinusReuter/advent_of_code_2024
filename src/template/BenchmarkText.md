Benchmarks are run on a Macbook Air M1 with 8GB of RAM and 8 cores. 
The benchmarks are executed in release mode with the following command measuring an average time (details in usage section):
```bash
cargo time --all --store
```

The parts of each day are benchmarked separately, their calculation does not share any data / runtime.
